# Phishing Awareness Demo Site ðŸŽ£

This project simulates a realistic phishing website designed for educational and research purposes.  
It demonstrates how phishing attacks can trick users into entering sensitive information, and how subtle design choices influence trust.

## Key Features

- Fake bank login page (mimicking a real bank site)
- Front-end loading spinner for "logging in" effect
- Security warning and time pressure banners to create urgency
- Navbar with fake account tabs to simulate a real dashboard
- Fake transaction history table to increase realism
- Backend server to capture and store login credentials (educational use only!)

## Research Applications

- **Educational Training**: Teach students and employees how phishing sites operate
- **User Behavior Analysis**: Study how design elements (like urgency, warnings) affect decision-making
- **Security Awareness Campaigns**: Use this as a live demo to show the dangers of untrusted links
- **Cybersecurity Research**: Serve as a mock platform for developing anti-phishing tools and detection algorithms

## Key Findings from Development

- Users are more likely to submit information when urgent banners ("Verify now to avoid suspension") are shown
- Professional-looking UI (even basic) dramatically increases trust
- Time pressure tactics (countdown timer) significantly reduce careful inspection by users
- Including fake transactions and multiple tabs builds an illusion of legitimacy

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Ilya-Abbasian/Phishing_Site_Proj_CMPINF1205.git

2. Navigate into the project folder:
   cd Phishing_Site_Proj_CMPINF1205

3. Run the front-end and back-end servers.

4. Visit localhost in your browser to see the phishing simulation.
